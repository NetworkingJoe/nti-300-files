echo "this is a step by step direction on how to add a text editor file for the text editor lab to my SSH and my repository"

1)The first step is to open my SSH instance by clicking next to my instance's I.P. address to the letter's SSH.

2)Once the instance is set up I would then use ls to see all of the files listed to find out where I want to navigate.

3)Once I know where I want to go, I would use the command cd "name of files, or repositories etc."

4)When I am in the repository or files that I want to create a new file in, I would type in vim "name of desired file".txt

5)After typing enter in the previous step above, I would then type "i" to go in to insert mode.

6)I would type in text that I need to type in using the "#!/bin/bash" line as the first line so that I can save properly.

7)Once satisfied with what I want in the text, I hit the "esc" button, and then type ":wq" to save my file.

8)After you are redirected to your previous page, you want to type in the command git add "name of text file" and type enter.

9)The next command is "git commit -m "text_you_want_to_type_to_describe_what_changes_you_want" followed by enter.

10)If the file has not been uploaded to your repository, try adding the command git push.

11)Enter your username for your github account.

12)Enter your password, and this should save your text file, though steps 10-12 shouldn't be necessary after your commit.
